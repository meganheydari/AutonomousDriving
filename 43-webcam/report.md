#  Skill 43, Webcam

Author: Team Skill, 2019-12-07

## Summary
The purpose of this skill was to get the webcam up and running for the sake of the quest. We SSHd into our rapsberry pi and plugged the webcam into the data input port of the Pi. Then to get the webcam functioning we used MJPG streamer to send out stream to be accessed on a port on the network. 

Once this was complete, we used the port address to add the video stream to our web client. We went on to use this to read QR codes.
